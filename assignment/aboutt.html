We are located in South Mysore, India and have around for about six years now.
We are home to the winners of the Indian Sieger 2006 and Indian Vice Siegers 2005/2007.
When we first started out as a kennel, it was quite a struggle,even struggling to get
placed in the class, but we have made rapid strides over these years, by picking up a 
number of awards over the past few years. Our Bred in India Female,
Doli of Shepmagic was the 3rd, 'Best in Show' at the FCI Show 2006 and was also adjudged
the best 'Bred in India Dog' at the same show. She was also the highest ranked 'Bred In
India GSD' in the 2006-07 Dog of the year points table. She is a truly wonderful female
who has been on a winning spree since the time she stepped into the ring.
