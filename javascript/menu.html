		<h1 class="h9">APPLE CIDER</h1>
		</dt>
		<dd style="color:blue">Brewed on a Christmas tree farm in Vermont, this cider has been tested and perfected by hundreds of Christmas tree shoppers over the years. Not only does it have the best blend of flavours, but the authenticity of a true North American winter.</dd><br>

	<dt><h1 class="h9">CANADIANO</h1></dt>
	<dd style="color:blue">During WWII, American soldiers in Europe couldn’t handle the straight stuff like Europeans, so they asked for their espresso watered down. Europeans (the original coffee geeks) nicknamed the drink “the Americano”. This is our patriotic take on that historic classic.</dd><br>

	<dt><h1 class="h9">CANADIANO MISTO</h1></dt>
	<dd style="color:blue">Delightfully smooth espresso over hot water with a cozy hug from steamed milk.</dd><br>

	<dt><h1 class="h9">COFFEE FRAPPE</h1></dt>
	<dd style="color:blue">The milkshake for adults, this frappe combines real ice cream with freshly extracted espresso, blended with ice. There are no premixes or powders in sight. Try adding your favourite flavour for an extra special treat.</dd><br>

	<dt><h1 class="h9">ESPRESSO</h1></dt>
	<dd style="color:blue">Equally bold and smooth, powerful and sweet, our signature espresso blend is complex and flavourful. It features strong notes of semi-sweet chocolate and caramel, with low acidity and a bright finish. It’s got ridiculous amounts of crema (ask your barista to point it out when they’re extracting it!), you can practically see the flavour and freshness.</dd><br>
